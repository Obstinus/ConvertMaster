# ConvertMaster
Convert PDFs to TXT and vice versa

## Installation

Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Obstinus/ConvertMaster.git
```

To use this script, you will first need to have the necessary libraries installed. These libraries are pdfplumber and fpdf. You can install them using the command below:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Use

```
python pdf2txt.py
```

Note: You need to edit the directories inside the pdf2txt.py file so that it knows where to fetch the PDF files and where to save the converted files.
